# Overview

I wanted to learn about React as it is one of the most popular front-end frameworks. To do this I need an app to use React around. 
I am building it around the idea of an app that lets you connect with friends on goals you each have and will ping each other when you have completed your task. 
I am working on how to make it most effective, but it will help two people connect on their respective goals and encourage progress.

Right now this app is a basic React app that has two pages: home and friends. The Home page has a button that when pressed displays a message.

I am writing this software to explore React and the idea of an accountability app.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I created this in Visual Studio and used Vite, React and Node.js.
I used React Router and React Router DOM.

# Useful Websites

- [Code Commerce YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Ha35zDngk)
This was by far the most helpful video when it came to learning how to route things in React.

# Future Work

- Add authorization/users
- Determine what functionality should exist for users to help each other
- Determine how to track progress and ping results to other user
